## **Learning objectives:**

-   How to convert the analysis that we have done so far into a **package**.
-   List benefits of developing a package.
-   Introduce `{fusen}` package to accelerate the process of building your package.
-   How to turn .Rmd files, including datasets, into a package.
-   Installing and sharing the package.
-   Conclusions

# 

-   Have you created an R package?

-   Have you created an R package?

-   Which R package(s) do you use frequently?

## **What is a package in R?**

-   In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the **package**. ![Source: https://pixabay.com/](img/package-img.webp){height="480px" width="320px"}

-   In simple terms, a package bundles together:

    -   code
    -   data
    -   documentation
    -   tests

-   Makes it easier to share with other users.

## **Benefits of developing an R package**

-   Reproducibility

-   Makes it easier to reuse across projects

-   Facilitates collaboration

## Introduction to `{fusen}`

## **`{fusen}` process steps**

```{r load-fusen-script}
if (!require("fusen")){
     install.packages("fusen")
     library(fusen)
}
```

Start an R session from your home (or Documents) directory and run the following:

```{r create-fusen}
fusen::create_fusen(path = "fusen.quickstart",
                    template = "minimal")
```

The `create_fusen` function creates:

-   a directory called `fusen.quickstart` in your Home directory
-   creates a `fusen.quickstart.Rproj` file
-   creates subfolders 'dev/' and 'R/
