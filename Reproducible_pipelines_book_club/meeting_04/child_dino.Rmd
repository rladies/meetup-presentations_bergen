## Analysis of the `r deparse(data)` dataset

### Correlation plot

```{r, echo = F}

print(create_plot(data))

```

### Correlation test statistics

```{r, echo = F}

correlation_test <- function(data){
  d <- datasaurus_dozen |> 
  filter(dataset == data) 
  cor.test(d$x, d$y)
}

correlation_test(data)

```

[Note:]{.underline} These very impressive plots and statistics were calculated at `r Sys.time()`
