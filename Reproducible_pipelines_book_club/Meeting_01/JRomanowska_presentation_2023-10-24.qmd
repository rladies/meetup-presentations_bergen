## Structure of the meetings

Proposed structure:

- short presentation
- exercises/hands-on/live coding
- discussion

::: notes

Presentation summarises the part from the book.

Use exercises from the book and/or some of your own!

Lastly, let's have time to talk, ask questions, ask for help on your problem...

> _We need your participation!_

::: notes
You can form teams, so that you will need to only prepare a very small part!

# Before we start...

## What is reproducibility?

. . .

::: incremental
Sharing:

- analysis steps
- inputs, outputs
- documentation: _data_ + _code_
- code used to generate each figure
- notes
- versions of software, packages, etc.
:::

::: notes
Ask first and wait for answers.

## Why do we need reproducibility?

::: notes
Ask first and wait for answers.

- do you know how to get to each single figure in the paper you published?
- do you know what is the content of the file X in a folder you created a year ago?
- would it be easy to continue on your/your colleague work?

# Fundamentals

## Prerequisites

::: incremental
- R is not RStudio
- text file vs. binary file
- R packages - _installation and use_
- variables/data in the environment
- file location, relative and absolute paths
