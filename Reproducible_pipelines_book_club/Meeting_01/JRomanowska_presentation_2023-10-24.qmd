## Overview of the book

## Structure of the meetings

Proposed structure:

- short presentation
- exercises/hands-on/live coding
- discussion

Presentation summarises the part from the book.

Use exercises from the book and/or some of your own!

Lastly, let's have time to talk, ask questions, ask for help on your problem...

## Why do we need reproducibility?

::: {.notes}

Ask first and wait for answers.

- do you know how to get to each single figure in the paper you published?
- do you know what is the content of the file X in a folder you created a year ago?
- would it be easy to continue on your/your colleague work?
