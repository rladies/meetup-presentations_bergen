# Reproducible pipelines book club <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/book-club-blue.svg?logo=bookstack">

## Description

We'll be meeting every month to go through and discuss the book
[“Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R” by Bruno Rodrigues](https://raps-with-r.dev/).

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-online-blue.svg?logo=zoom"> The meetings are held online, on Zoom, and will not be recorded because we want
all the attendees to discuss freely any topic they want to.

**The book club needs your participation**, so don't hesitate to contact any of
us (organizers in [R-Ladies Bergen](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-bergen/members/?op=leaders)
and [R-Ladies Cologne](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-cologne/members/?op=leaders))
and sign up!
