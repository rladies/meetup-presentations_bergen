This workshop delves into Chapter 9 of the book “Building Reproducible Analytical Pipelines with R” by Bruno Rodrigues. This chapter marks the beginning of Part 2: "Write IT down," within the book.

The workshop aims to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the concepts outlined in Chapter 9, focusing on practical implementation. All workshop materials are housed within this designated folder.

Here are the two R files previously generated in the book and utilized again in Chapter 9: 

save_data.R: https://is.gd/7PhUjd
analysis.R: https://is.gd/X7XXJg

Please save them and add them to a folder, you may name it "housing".

I used the following two codes in the terminal to download the scripts one more time: 

wget --content-disposition https://is.gd/7PhUjd
wget --content-disposition https://is.gd/X7XXJg

Reading recommendations at the end of Chapter 9:
