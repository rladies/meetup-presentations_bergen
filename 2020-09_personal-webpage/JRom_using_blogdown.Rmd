## Modern webpage anatomy

I need to precise here: we're talking about a _static_ webpage, where the
user does not have possibility to create new content live.

The webpage elements are as follows:

- **HTML** = hypertext markup language
    - this is the content part
    - includes all the text and images displayed, and some meta-information, but it doesn't have to include _formatting_ or _styling_
- **CSS** = cascade style sheets
    - this collects all the information about _formatting_
    - if one wants to refresh the webpage look, changes need to be made here
- **javascript**
    - optional, but often used element that allows for some _special effects_
    - e.g., displaying a message box in response to a click

Think about the HTML part as a bag of containers that sort the content of the webpage into tabs, parts, or paragraphs. These containers can then be styled by the CSS rules (e.g., stating that one paragraph should be beside another one, text in the headline should be bold and green, while yet another container should be on the margin, and with yellow text). Finally, the optional javascript can be used to make some animations, etc.

However, thanks to blogdown (and Hugo), we do not need to learn all these elements from scratch when we want to build a simple static webpage.

## Blogdown elements

> _Blogdown is a package that ports Hugo to R and Rmarkdown_

https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-sites.html

Key elements to master:

- **Rmarkdown**
- **TOML** = Tom's Obvious Minimal Language
    - https://toml.io/en/

???

Key elements to master:

- **Rmarkdown**
    - we can generate html webpages with Rmarkdown!
    - hint: do not use the ``output`` parameter in YAML header
    - https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/content.html
- **TOML**
    - this is the language of the configuration script for Hugo
    - deals with parameters and some formatting of the webpages
    - blogdown also allows **YAML** (Yet Another Markup Language)
    - https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/configuration.html#toml-syntax

We'll see some examples soon, but what is important is to note that Hugo creates
all the necessary files, so we will need to only change some stuff.

---

## Main functions

- create a new RStudio project (e.g., `blogdown_test`)
- run `blogdown::new_site()`
- check the directories and output
- check the visual part with `blogdown::serve_site()`
- make some changes in the `content` directory and/or `config.toml`
- re-create the webpage with `blogdown::build_site()`
- _when you're ready, stop the server with `servr::daemon_stop(1)`_

???

Check the anatomy of directories after "new_site" is called.

General hierarchy:

- **config.toml**
    - here are all the parameters, title, author, images, location of extra files, etc.
- **content/**
    - here you can put all the .Rmd or .md files with content
- **static/**
    - here is the place for all the images and/or javascript, css
- **themes/**
    - you can have copies of the webpage themes here and alter between them by tweaking ``config.toml``
- **layouts/**
    - here are configuration files (.toml) for the parts of the webpage that are common for all the sub-pages (i.e., header, menu, footer, etc.)


---

## Find a theme

- Go to https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-scroll
  - (for more themes, checkout https://themes.gohugo.io/)
  - clone the repo to the `themes` subdirectory of our newly built website

- Merge the contents generated by the `blogdown::new_site()` command
  and the contents inside `example_site` directory of the hugo-scroll repo
  - remove the directories: `content`, `static`
  - copy the directories from the `example_site`: `content`, `static`, `layouts`
  - compare `config.toml` from Blogdown default and your chosen theme

- Run the following commands and enjoy

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::build_site()
blogdown::serve_site()
```

???

There is always a directory named "example_site", where everything is publication-ready
and there one can check and learn how to manipulate everything.

## Publishing

- GitHub instructions: https://pages.github.com/
- Bitbucket instructions: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud/
- other possibilities: https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html

???

When publishing, push to the server only the contents of the ``public`` directory in your blogdown folder!
